        <h2>What my competitors are doing right now</h2>
            <p>
                From what I have experienced, I see my competitors having integrate cultural elements into the dining experience, such as traditional music, art, and decor.
                This would often attract customers who are interested in the culture and want to experience it. They would also use high-quality ingredients to enhance the aste and authenticity
                of their dishes. Being engaged with the local community through partnerships, events, or sponsorships.
            </p>
        <h2>What my Competitors are doing wrong</h2>
            <p>
                 Is the inconsistency in quality and service can lead to customer dissatisfaction and poor reviews. Long wait times for orders
                 and from what I have seen is restaurants failing to effectively marketing their unique offerings.
            </p>
        <h2>How I can do it Better</h2>
            <p>
                I could develop a user-friendly website and a mobile app for online ordering and resverations. Probadly adding in some multiple payment options, including digital wallets.
                Establishing standardized recpies and training staff to maintain consistency. Offer options for those who have dietary restrictions
